  - User-specific storage
  - Empty UID handling
  
- [x] EnrollmentProvider: 13 test cases
  - Initial state
  - isEnrolled returns false for non-enrolled
  - enroll adds program
  - enroll persists to repository
  - No duplicate enrollments
  - unenroll removes program
  - unenroll persists to repository
  - onAuthChanged loads existing enrollments
  - onAuthChanged clears for empty UID
  - User switching
  - Enroll without user does nothing
  - Unenroll without user does nothing
  
- [x] ProgramService: 2 test cases
  - Loads programs from JSON
  - Returns empty list on error

### Integration Tests
- [x] 4 test cases
  - Shows "Enroll Now" for unenrolled program
  - Shows "Continue" for enrolled program
  - Tapping "Enroll Now" enrolls user
  - Enrollment persists across provider recreation

Total: 26 test cases, 384 lines of test code

## ‚úÖ Dependency Verification

Check pubspec.yaml:
- [x] provider: ^6.1.1 added
- [x] shared_preferences: ^2.2.2 present
- [x] assets/data/ declared in flutter assets

## ‚úÖ Functionality Verification

### Manual Test Steps

1. **Initial Load**
   - [ ] App launches without errors
   - [ ] Navigate to Program Listings
   - [ ] 5 programs displayed from JSON
   - [ ] No "Enrolled" badges initially
   - [ ] All CTAs show "View Details"

2. **Enrollment Flow**
   - [ ] Tap on "AI & ML Skill Development"
   - [ ] Program details page opens
   - [ ] "Enroll Now" button visible
   - [ ] Tap "Enroll Now"
   - [ ] Navigate to EnrolledCoursePage
   - [ ] Week 1 is unlocked
   - [ ] Weeks 2-8 are locked
   - [ ] Go back to Program Listings
   - [ ] "Enrolled" badge appears on AI & ML
   - [ ] CTA changed to "Continue"

3. **Multiple Enrollments**
   - [ ] Enroll in "Web Development Bootcamp"
   - [ ] Enroll in "Cybersecurity Fundamentals"
   - [ ] All 3 enrolled programs show "Enrolled" badge
   - [ ] All 3 show "Continue" CTA

   - [ ] Tap "Continue" on any enrolled program
   - [ ] Opens EnrolledCoursePage correctly

5. **Progress Gating**
   - [ ] Open an enrolled course
   - [ ] Week 1 unlocked (can expand)
   - [ ] Weeks 2+ locked (show lock icon)
   - [ ] Tap on Week 2
   - [ ] Snackbar shows lock message
