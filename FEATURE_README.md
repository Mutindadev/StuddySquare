# Week 3: Enrollment State & Progress Gating - Implementation Complete ✅

This feature branch implements enrollment state management and JSON-driven content for the StudySquare experiential learning app as specified in Week 3 requirements.

## 🎯 Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All requirements have been implemented, tested, documented, and verified.

## 📋 Quick Links

- **[WEEK3_SUMMARY.md](WEEK3_SUMMARY.md)**: Feature overview and implementation summary
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md](IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md)**: Technical documentation and architecture
- **[VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md](VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md)**: Comprehensive QA testing guide
- **[validate_programs.py](validate_programs.py)**: Automated JSON validation tool

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

### 1. JSON-Driven Program Data
- Created `assets/data/programs.json` with 5 comprehensive programs
- Each program has 6-8 weeks with detailed weekly tasks
- Total: 102 tasks across all programs (READING/QUIZ/PROJECT types)

### 2. State Management
- Implemented `EnrollmentProvider` using Provider pattern
- Created `EnrollmentRepository` for local persistence
- Added `ProgramService` for async JSON loading
- Integrated with app using ChangeNotifierProvider

### 3. Dynamic UI
- Program listings show "Enrolled" badge for enrolled programs
- CTA changes from "View Details" to "Continue" based on enrollment
- Program detail page button changes from "Enroll Now" to "Continue"
- Immediate UI updates on enrollment
- Week 2 styling preserved (purple theme, gradients)

### 4. Persistence
- Enrollments persist using SharedPreferences
- Per-user storage with `enrollments_{uid}` key
- Reloads on app start via `onAuthChanged()`

### 5. Progress Gating
- Existing functionality preserved
- Week 1 always unlocked
- Later weeks locked until previous week completed
- Visual indicators (lock icons, disabled state)

## 🎨 UI Behavior Examples

### Before Enrollment
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AI & ML Skill Development           │
│ [Intermediate]                      │
│ Description...                      │
│ ⏰ 8 weeks    View Details →        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After Enrollment
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AI & ML Skill Development           │
│ [Intermediate] [Enrolled]           │
│ Description...                      │
│ ⏰ 8 weeks    Continue →             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
